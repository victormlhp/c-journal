//Introduction
Hi !

My name is Victor and I am a Business Consultant with a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration and an Executive MBA. I’m 32 years old, born and raised in the Dominican Republic a small country in the Hispaniola Island located in the Caribbean. It is common that people from the other side of the world don’t know anything about of the Dominican Republic, well, our nearest neighbor is Haiti, a very poor country located on the same island. Haiti does ring a bell to everybody, so yes we are the country next to Haiti.

On this blog, I will share my experience of my journey of learning computer programming. I have been flirting with the idea for years now and I don’t want to regret it in the future if I don’t take action and learn.

Do you think I am too old? Let’s Find out together.
